# Notebooks

This folder contains the analysis notebooks used in the Cat Adoption Analysis project.

## Structure

- `01_exploratory_data_analysis.ipynb`  
  Exploratory analysis of intake and adoption patterns, feature behavior, and data quality issues.

- `02_predictive_modeling.ipynb`  
  Predictive modeling for 30-day adoption likelihood and conditional length of stay, including model evaluation and feature importance.

- `03_ab_testing_name_presence.ipynb`  
  Observational A/B-style analysis of naming at intake, statistical testing, and rollout simulations.

## HTML Versions

For convenience and reproducibility, each notebook is also included as an exported **HTML file**.  
These files can be downloaded and then viewed locally in a browser without requiring a Python environment.

HTML files are intended for:
- Quick review by non-technical stakeholders
- Archived analysis results at the time of completion

The full code remains the `.ipynb` notebooks.
