    "# A/B Test: Effect of Name Presence at Intake on Adoption Outcomes within 30 Days\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary & Recommendation\n",
    "\n",
    "Having a name corresponds to a directional increase in adoption rate within 30 days, with low operational cost and low risk, although the evidence is not causal.\n",
    "\n",
    "I recommend a limited rollout of assigning temporary names to unnamed cats, while monitoring adoption rate as the primary metric and length of stay as a guardrail metric.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Business Question\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Should the animal center assign names to all unnamed cats to improve adoption outcomes?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this analysis is to evaluate whether having a name improves adoption outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "This intervention occurs right after intake, early in the adoption funnel, and affects how cats are presented in listings and communications.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "A cat's name evokes positive emotions, such as excitement or affection, from potential pet owners. Thus, \n",
    "> *adding a name increases adoption rate within 30 days of intake*.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "- Primary metric: Adoption rate within 30 days of intake (\"30-day adoption rate\")\n",
    "- Guardrail: Length of stay (LOS) among cats adopted within 30 days of intake\n",
    "\n",
    "Trade-offs considered are operational effort versus expected lift, and adoption speed versus volume.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Experimental Design & Constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "- Control group: Cats without a name at intake\n",
    "- Treatment group: Cats with a name at intake\n",
    "- Population: Intakes with observed outcomes from similar intake types (\"Owner Surrender\", \"Abandoned\", and \"Stray\")\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis compares **naturally occurring groups** (named vs unnamed cats) rather than randomly assigned treatments, so it’s observational, not randomized. Therefore, results are interpreted as **directional evidence, not causal proof**. Noise from seasonality and intake mix is expected."

    "## Results \n",
    "\n",
    "**Named cats have a significantly higher 30-day adoption rate**. The difference in LOS is small and not adverse. \n",
    "\n",
    "Given the low cost of the implementation, the risk of inaction likely exceeds the risk of action.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Final Recommendation\n",
    "\n",
    "Assigning names at intake shows a directional lift in 30-day adoption rates, with no clear evidence of downside risk. The effect size may be modest, but at the scale of the animal center, it adds up.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the low cost and minimal operational risk, I **recommend a limited rollout: assign temporary names** to unnamed cats at intake and **monitor 30-day adoption rate as the primary metric, with LOS as a guardrail**. This captures upside while containing any risks and avoids delaying action for a perfect signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Potential Next Step: Randomization\n",
    "\n",
    "If feasible, the next step would be a **randomized test at intake**, where unnamed cats are randomly assigned to receive a temporary name or not. Randomization would remove intake-related confounding factors and allow for a clearer estimate of the causal effect of naming.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary decision metric would remain 30-day adoption rate, with LOS as a guardrail. The goal to evaluate the effect well enough to decide whether naming cats should become a permanent policy.\n",

To support a real policy decision, I combine this observational evidence with simulations that apply a conservative uplift of 10% to each cat’s baseline adoption probability.

    "Based on the simulation, naming cats that arrive without names is expected to produce a directional increase in adoptions within 30 days, with impact scaling proportionally to rollout size. \n",
    "\n",
    "**At current intake volumes (~2,100 no-name cats/year), a full rollout assuming a 10% uplift corresponds to approximately 1000 additional 30-day adoptions per year**, while partial rollouts capture a meaningful share of that upside with lower operational effort.\n",
    "\n",
    "These estimates do not prove causality and should be interpreted as planning inputs rather than forecasts. The results assume a stable intake mix and do not account for post-intake constraints such as shelter resources or staffing. Given the low downside risk and low implementation cost in naming cats, I recommend a limited rollout with monitoring to validate impact before scaling further."
